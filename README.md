## Todo
 - [x] Add least cheats (almost)
 - [ ] Menu Mouse Hook (maybe keep player in pause while setting some cheats?)
 - [x] Maybe some config system? (half of work is done)
 - [x] Bind system (re-bind keys, allowed only one key per bind)
 - [ ] Maybe add different headers and sources files for specific objects in game?
 - [ ] Re-write entire cheat (since it doesn't show for other but me)
